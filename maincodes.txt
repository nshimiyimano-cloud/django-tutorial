so when you create template eg template/meetups/index.html never the folder is relative here its from render(request,'meetups/index.html')
by default static html to be returned in view is kept by default in template folder

 
so to work with static we need to use django feature called static where search for static folder and take as it have css javascript that why they say django is batteries included  always u need to create static folder in root of ur app or module u have created and repeat ur app name inside static to prevent from crashing of app(as unique)  eg static/meetups/styles or script folder for js
. we finish to use our css in template(html) by use django teplating engine at top on html we load static by use {% load static %}  and in css link we put href="{% static 'meetups/stles/basic.css' %}" we dot need to static from static as folder ready known by django


# /meetups/<dynamic path segment>   ega-first-meetups as slug
 path('meetups/<slug:meetup_slug>',views.meetup_details)  to get dynamic url we do like this meetup_slug is 2nd parameter from meetup view on eg meetup_dedail(request,meetup_slug):

 we use href="{% url 'meetup_details'  meetup_item.slug %} "  u let space and dynamic path correspond with eg meetup_slug' defined in view and specified in url.py this allow us to get dynamic absolute url in template(x.html) we have define in url.py instead of rewrite again and again we use name of url we specified in url.py on path("/meetups/<slug:meetup_slug>",views.meetup_details,name='meetupp_details')
 .the best of use dynamic path even you change path in url  path('meetups/<slug:meetup_slug>',views.meetup_details,name='meetup-detail')  eg to path('home',..,name='meetup_details') its still work path begin rendered by django when u have used djangotemplating language like this {% url 'name-of-url' datawithrenderddynamically as dynamic path %}

 django templating engine language i m able to use

 include or include '..' with Svariable u want %}

 load static

You are trying to add a non-nullable field 'title' to meetups without a default; we can't do that (the database needs something to populate existing rows).
Please select a fix:
 1) Provide a one-off default now (will be set on all existing rows with a null value for this column)
 2) Quit, and let me add a default in models.py
Select an option: 1
Please enter the default value now, as valid Python
The datetime and django.utils.timezone modules are available, so you can do e.g. timezone.now
Type 'exit' to exit this prompt

if u start to use image Upload in modal or in django u will see error NameError: name 'upload_to' is not defined, django.core.management.base.SystemCheckError: SystemCheckError: System check identified some issues:
ERRORS:The headers or library files could not be found for jpeg,
    a required dependency when compiling Pillow from source.
    

meetups.Meetups.image: (fields.E210) Cannot use ImageField because Pillow is not installed.
	HINT: Get Pillow at https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/ or run command "python -m pip install Pillow".



->SOLUTION: here to fix it we need to install pillow in our system or in our virtual environment
so PILLAW  package Django will user under the hood when working with images


second question if you told  

The headers or library files could not be found for jpeg,
    a required dependency when compiling Pillow from source.
    

    run these two command works very well  

    (django_course_env) lab@lab-Inspiron-5559:~/Desktop/learn/learndjango/django_course_site$ sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev
[sudo] password for lab: 
viously unselected package libjpeg-dev:amd64.
Preparing to unpack .../libjpeg-dev_8c-2ubuntu8_amd64.deb ...
succesfully ...




after : pip install Pillow


. at the next level we finish to configure pillow and to upload image via admin area its possible 
.whats next we need to configure server to serve /file url to be able read image on django server here we will need to use new feature of django called 'static' 

in main url eg from django.conf.urls.static import static after configure serving on server its will work on facing front end
