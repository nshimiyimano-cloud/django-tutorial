so when you create template eg template/meetups/index.html never the folder is relative here its from render(request,'meetups/index.html')
by default static html to be returned in view is kept by default in template folder

 
so to work with static we need to use django feature called static where search for static folder and take as it have css javascript that why they say django is batteries included  always u need to create static folder in root of ur app or module u have created and repeat ur app name inside static to prevent from crashing of app(as unique)  eg static/meetups/styles or script folder for js
. we finish to use our css in template(html) by use django teplating engine at top on html we load static by use {% load static %}  and in css link we put href="{% static 'meetups/stles/basic.css' %}" we dot need to static from static as folder ready known by django


# /meetups/<dynamic path segment>   ega-first-meetups as slug
 path('meetups/<slug:meetup_slug>',views.meetup_details)  to get dynamic url we do like this meetup_slug is 2nd parameter from meetup view on eg meetup_dedail(request,meetup_slug):

 we use href="{% url 'meetup_details'  meetup_item.slug %} "  u let space and dynamic path correspond with eg meetup_slug' defined in view and specified in url.py this allow us to get dynamic absolute url in template(x.html) we have define in url.py instead of rewrite again and again we use name of url we specified in url.py on path("/meetups/<slug:meetup_slug>",views.meetup_details,name='meetupp_details')
 .the best of use dynamic path even you change path in url  path('meetups/<slug:meetup_slug>',views.meetup_details,name='meetup-detail')  eg to path('home',..,name='meetup_details') its still work path begin rendered by django when u have used djangotemplating language like this {% url 'name-of-url' datawithrenderddynamically as dynamic path %}

 django templating engine language i m able to use

 include or include '..' with Svariable u want %}
